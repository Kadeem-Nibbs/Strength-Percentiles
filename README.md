This program will be eventually be able to scrape several bodybuilding and powerlifting websites for gym-goers’ squat, bench, and deadlift numbers, storing them in one or more SQL databases.  The program will offer services such as allowing users to enter their own one-rep maxes in the squat, bench, and/or deadlift and get their percentile rank among the sampled lifter population.  Further down the line, the program will let user’s enter their one-rep maxes and then estimate where they will finish in certain powerlifting competitions, or suggest competitions where they would place highest.
