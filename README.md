This program scrapes the results of a New York State powerlifting meet and stores the meet results in a local database.  Users can enter their own one-rep maxes in the squat, bench, and/or deadlift and get their percentile rank among the sampled lifter population.  Further down the line, the program will let userâ€™s enter their one-rep maxes and then estimate where they will finish in certain powerlifting competitions, or suggest competitions where they would place highest.
